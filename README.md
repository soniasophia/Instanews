## Project Objective
- Create a one-page, responsive website to filter top news stories from the New York Times API
- Optimize for 3 widths: mobile, min-width: 600px and min-width: 1000px

## Technologies Used
- Git Bash (https://git-for-windows.github.io/)
- Google Chrome Developer Tools
- Gulp (autoprefixer, cssnano, eslint, notify, plumber, rename, sass, uglify)
- Font Squirrel (https://www.fontsquirrel.com/)
- Ajax
- JavaScript
- jQuery (https://jquery.com/)
- Sass
- Coality



## Personal Learnings
- Learned how to use SASS as a CSS preprocessor and makes the organization of all the CSS style rules much easier and cleaner to read.
- Used Gulp and its various plugins for the first time for a project and gained a lot of insight into how to properly set up and organize the files of a new project.
- Learned how to request data using an API and how to filter through a list using JavaScript.
- Adding new classes to elements after event changes are useful when applying new styles.
